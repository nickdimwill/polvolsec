## Political volunteer security training

> *I don't do anything particularly critical, why should I follow this?*
> 
> These are good tips for daily life to keep your information safe.
> In a political context, it is even more important due to your trusted position.

### Basics
- Use password on all computers.
- Use passcode/lock screen on phone.
- Use two-factor authentication on all available accounts.
- Run software and OS updates. Security flaws are discovered and fixed all the time.
- Do not use the same password on different accounts.
- Do not use repeated password patterns (penguin1, penguin2).
- A good password is long, like the series of words `correct horse battery staple`
- Do not click suspicious links or attachments in emails. Practice skepticism. 

### More
- Do not share passwords.
- Do not write passwords down on a sticky note attached to your monitor.
- Use a password manager such as 1Password to make it easier to use the strongest passwords.
- On your mac, turn on full-disk encryption.
- Use Firefox for your internet browser. 
- Avoid text messages (SMS/iMessage/etc). They are NOT encrypted. Recommended: phone call, video chat, Signal, Telegram.
- For two-factor authentication, it's much better to use a physical key like YubiKey or Google Titan.

### Campaigns
- Designate someone to consider your digital security.
- Treat "private" communication on Twitter/Facebook/Slack as if it were public.
- Use a dedicated email address for political work vs personal life.
- Share documents in Google Drive, not as email attachments.

### Extra credit
- Install uBlock Origin and HTTPS Everywhere extensions for browser. Avoid using any other extensions.
- Use widely-used open-source software where possible. More eyes on the source code means more vulnerabilities fixed.
- Don't allow 3rd-party apps to have access to your email.
- Look at what 3rd-part apps you have installed on your phone. Watch what permissions they ask for at installation.
