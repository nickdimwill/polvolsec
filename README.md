# Political volunteer security training

### Basics
* [ ] Use password on all computers.
* [ ] Use passcode/lock screen on phone.
* [ ] Use two-factor authentication on any accounts.
* [ ] Keep software and OS up to date. Security flaws are found and fixed all the time.
* [ ] Do not ever use the same password across different systems. If one account gets compromised, you can assume they all are. 
* [ ] Do not use repeated password patterns (e.g. gmail: horse1, facebook: horse2, twitter: horse3). If one account gets compromised, you can assume they all are.

### More
* [ ] Use Google Chrome for your internet browser. 
* [ ] For two-factor authentication, it's preferable to use an authentictor app like Google Authenticator or Authy.
* [ ] Avoid plain text messages (SMS/iMessage/etc). They are NOT encrypted. Recommended: phone call, video chat, Signal, Telegram. 
* [ ] Treat "private" communication on Twitter/Facebook/Slack as if it were public. Otherwise, avoid using as a private messenger.
* [ ] Don't allow 3rd-party apps to have access to your email.
* [ ] Use a dedicated email address for political work vs personal life.
* [ ] Look at what 3rd-part apps you have installed on your phone. Watch what permissions they ask for at installation.
* [ ] By virtue of being simpler, your phone is more secure than your laptop/PC.
* [ ] On your mac, turn on full-disk encryption.

### Even more
* [ ] Install uBlock Origin and HTTPS Everywhere extensions for your Chrome browser to make sure your browsing is encrypted. Avoid using any other extensions.
* [ ] Browse internet using incognito mode.
* [ ] If a website seems sketchy, get off it.
* [ ] Use widely-used open-source software where possible. More eyes on the source code means more vulnerabilities fixed.

#### Questions

*Who to contact if I think campaign is being actively targetted?*

ANSWER

*Within a campaign who I talk to about security procedures?*

Talk to x... if campaign does not have a designated contact for security concerns, keep going up...

*I don't do anything particularly critical, why should I follow this?*

Your email address is a trusted contact within a campaign, so you receive sensitive internal information. And imagine how much confusion could be caused by sending misleading information from you account to others within the campaign.
